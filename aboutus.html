        <h3>Anna Nguyen</h3>
            <p>Hi everyone! My name is Anna Nguyen and I'm currently a second year Computer Science major with a Management minor. I'm interested in specializing in Information; however, I'm also interested in AI and Machine Learning. I'm an out-of-state student originally from Ohio and I love traveling so I want to live in many places throughout my life. In my free time I like to watch Netflix, listen to music, play guitar/piano, or hang out with friends.</p>
